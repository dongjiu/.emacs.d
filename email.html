        <div>Hi Team,</div>
        <div>I have uploaded db scripts to the repo and added a SQL Server Unit Testing project. Please review the <a href="https://msasg.visualstudio.com/Bing_Ads/UCM%20Team/_git/UCM-StagingArea/pullrequest/491518?_a=files">PR</a>.</div>
        <div>For the data factories, I think it's easier to just import the whole project from Azure than adding delta changes to the existing project. I will do the importing next week since there are some errors in it. <span class="at">@Xiaoyu</span>, please take a look into the errors in the ADF for SA publisher next week. It looks that the errors are caused by the schema name changes.</div>
